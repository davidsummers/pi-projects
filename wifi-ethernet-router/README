This project sets up a Raspberry PI to connect to the internet using the WIFI
and share the WIFI connection with the Ethernet connection so that any router
or device connected to the Ethernet connection can also use the internet.

Installation Instructions
=========================

- Install Raspberry Pi OS (Raspbian) on a microSD card
  and insert it into the Raspberry PI microSD card slot.

- Connect a monitor, mouse, and keyboard to the Raspberry PI

- Power up the Raspberry PI

  It should start up, and then reboot itself after resizing the partitions.

- Go through the guided setup, finishing by configuring the WIFI connection.

- Configure SSH by going to the Raspberry PI icon and selecting

  Preferences -> Raspberry PI Configuration menu item.

  Select the "Interfaces" tab and click "Enable" button on the SSH line. 


  Then press the "OK" button.

- Start a terminal windoww by selecting "Terminal" icon.

- Type:

  git clone https://github.com/davidsummers/pi-projects
  cd pi-projects/wifi-ethernet-router
  make
  sudo reboot

- The Raspberry PI should complete all the above without errors, and reboot.

- After it is rebooted, any router or device you plug into the ethernet port
  should get access to the Internet.
